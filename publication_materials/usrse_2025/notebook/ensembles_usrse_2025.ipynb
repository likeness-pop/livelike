    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Synthetic populations** are realistic virtual representations of people and households within localities (e.g., neighborhoods) comprising an area of interest. They are often derived from anonymized population surveys via probabilistic estimation of survey responses among localities (**small-area weights**) based on summary statistics for those areas (e.g., people by occupation, households by dwelling type).\n",
    "\n",
    "A key application of synthetic populations is better understanding the social composition of localities to support tasks like planning and civil engineering. To accomplish this, the small-area weights are aggregated into **small-area estimates (SAEs)** that provide cross-sectional measures of individual or residential characteristics at high spatial resolution. The SAEs are useful to answer questions like: _which neighborhoods in my city could have increased transportation costs for workers based on a combination of job type, frequency of work attendance, and travel time?_\n",
    "\n",
    "**Synthetic population ensembles** consist of multiple plausible synthetic populations for an area relative to variability in the population survey and the model used to produce the small-area weights. The ensembles enable uncertainty quantification on the SAEs. In this example, we demonstrate the functionality of the [Likeness Python stack](https://github.com/likeness-pop) for producing SAEs related to individual and household energy affordability using data from the [American Community Survey (ACS) 2019 - 2023 5-Year Estimates](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/acs-5year.html). We focus on the [`livelike` package](https://github.com/likeness-pop/livelike), which provides utilities for data preprocessing, model specification, and small-area estimation via the ACS [Public Use Micordata Sample (PUMS)](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/microdata.html) (population survey) and [Summary File (SF)](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/data/summary-file.html) (summary statistics).\n",
